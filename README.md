## Description 
Personal portfolio webpage built using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap in the hopes of using it later on to showcase the skills I've learned in the UNC-Charlotte coding boot camp. For this particular project I specifically tried to showcase the use of links to in browser navigation and to external projects and professional social media pages. As well as the use of FlexBox and other advanced CSS techniques. There is still a lot of work to be done especially in regards to making it mobile responsive.

None.
