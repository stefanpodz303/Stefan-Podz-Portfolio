## Description and Purpose of Work:

- Built a personal portfolio webpage from scratch using HTML and CSS in the hopes of using it later on to showcase the skills I've learned in the UNC-Charlotte coding boot camp.
- For this particular project I specifically tried to showcase the use of links to in browser navigation and to external projects and professional social media pages. As well as the use of FlexBox and other advanced CSS techniques. 
- Unfortunately, I was not able to to get all of my CSS techniques to work exactly how I wanted, for example "media queries" to reformat my page for multiple device use, but my hope is this page gives me a foundation in which to return and build upon my skills.
